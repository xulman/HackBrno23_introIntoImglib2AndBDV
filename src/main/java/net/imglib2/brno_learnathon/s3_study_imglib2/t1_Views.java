		//It was also noted that it usually resorts to requesting RAIs, instead of

		//
		//image.cursor(); //doesn't work, type-wise it is a pure RAI

		//the later restores always the "normal" iterability (scanning fully first dimension, and
		//only then the scanning is moved in the second dimension etc.).

		//Note that since Java offers reflection, it is possible to figure out during the runtime
		//what class a given object actually is. It may turn out that the input RAI is actually
		//stripped down 'Img' where the iterability was provided, and if that is the case this

		//This session is about the utility class Views -- a collection of extremely useful
		//tools in the hands of image processing programmer, where a tool = one individual View.

		//The governing idea of the Views is basically, considering now a single View on a given
		//input image, to provide a fake, made-up image that shows certain modified version
		//of the input image. The input image is never modified, and the provided made-up image
		//is computed on-demand and on-the-fly.
		//
		//Another strong design motif is that the Views can be chained. This allows for the
		//building of sophisticated constructs over original "normal" images. These constructs
		//are, again, evaluated only on on-demand basis and shall not be proactively computed, and
		//thus memorized on some discrete grids, which would have lead to accuracy and information loss.
		//
		//Especially, however, the Views can masquerade (alleviate) the usual "technicalities"
		//present in image processing pipelines (such as treating boundary conditions within the
		//main for loop), enabling the programmer to focus on the image processing itself.

		//Examples of Views are reduction of the input image dimensionality, flipping axes,
		//extending images with "procedurally generated outside surroundings", or various
		//image transforms. A complete list of them is best obtained using the autocompletion
		//functionality of most IDEs, just type 'Views.' and study the pop-up list of available
		//methods...
